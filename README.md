# 2048-api
A 2048 game api for training supervised learning (imitation learning) or reinforcement learning agents


# Training

Run Trainlstm.py to trainlstm model with game transations data obtained by expectMax agent(not provided here).

# Testing

model-05.hdf5 is my final model.
Run evaluate.py to test.

# reinforcement learning 

RL algorithms code are under RL folder.
Each code can be run independently.
